1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,740
Some days you're the only thing I know Only thing that's burning when the nights

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,700
grow cold Can't look away, can't look away

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,100
Beg you to stay, beg you to stay, yeah Sometimes you're a stranger in my bed

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,000
Don't know if you love me or you want me dead

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Push me away, push me away Beg me to stay, beg me to stay, yeah

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,600
Call me in the morning to apologize Every little eye gives me butterflies

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,600
Something in the wind looking through my eyes Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet Talk so pretty but you're a party

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Late night devil put your hands on me And never, never, never, ever let go

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet Talk so pretty but you're a party

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Late night devil put your hands on me And never, never, never, ever let go

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Some days you're the best thing in my life Sometimes when I look at you I see my wife

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,600
And you're down into somebody I don't know And you push me away, push me away, yeah

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Call me in the morning to apologize Every little eye gives me butterflies

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Something in the wind looking through my eyes Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet Talk so pretty but you're a party

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Late night devil put your hands on me And never, never, never, ever let go

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet Talk so pretty but you're a party

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Late night devil put your hands on me And never, never, never, ever let go

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Blood on my shirt, rose in my hand You're looking at me like you don't know who I am

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hand Still I'll be there

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet Talk so pretty but you're a party

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Late night devil put your hands on me And never, never, never, ever let go

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet Talk so pretty but you're a party

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Late night devil put your hands on me And never, never, never, ever let go

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Never, never, never, ever let go

27
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
