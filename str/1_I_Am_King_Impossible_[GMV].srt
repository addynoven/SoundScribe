1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I remember years ago someone told me I should take caution when it comes to love

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I did, I did

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You were strong and I was not my illusion, my mistake

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was careless, I forgot I did, I did

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And now, when all is done there is nothing to say

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You have gone, it's a effortless slate

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Show them all I know now

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Shout it from the roaches

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I've landed on the skyline

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All we had is gone now

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Show them I was happy

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And my heart is broken

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All my scars are open

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Tell them what I hope will be

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Falling out of love is hard

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Falling for betraying's worth

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Broken trust and broken hearts

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I know, I know

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thinking all you need is there

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Building faith, all love and word

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Empty promises will wear

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I know, I know

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And now, when all is gone there is nothing to say

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And if you're done with embarrassing me

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
On your own you can go ahead tell them

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Tell them all I know now

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Shout it from the rooftops

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've landed on the skyline

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All we had is gone now

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Tell them I was happy

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And my heart is broken

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All my scars are open

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tell them what I hope would be

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Impossible, impossible, impossible

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I remember years ago

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Someone told me I should take caution

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When it comes to love I didn't

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell them all I know now

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Shout it from the rooftops

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I've landed on the skyline

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All we had is gone now

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Tell them I was happy

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And my heart is broken

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All my scars are open

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They'll live a life of what I've been

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Impossible, impossible, impossible

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Impossible, impossible, impossible

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Impossible, impossible, impossible

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Impossible

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I remember years ago

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Someone told me I should take caution

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When it comes to love I didn't

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Tell them I was happy
