00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
["I Want to Take You Somewhere"]

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,500
I wanna take you somewhere, so you know I care

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
But it's so cold and I don't know where

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,000
I brought you daffodils and a pretty string

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But they won't flower like the flowers spring

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm just so tired to share my nights

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wanna cry and I wanna love

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But all my tears have been used up

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
On another love, another love

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
All my tears have been used up

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On another love, another love

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All my tears have been used up

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
On another love, another love

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All my tears have been used up

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
On another love, another love

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But my hand's been broken one too many times

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Watch they always win, but I know I'll lose

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I'd sing a song that'd be just stars

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But I sang a love to another heart

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I wanna cry, I wanna love to love

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But all my tears have been used up

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
On another love, another love

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All my tears have been used up

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
On another love, another love

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All my tears have been used up

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
On another love, another love

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All my tears have been used up

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, oh

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, oh

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, oh

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I wanna sing a song that'd be just stars

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I sang a love to another heart

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But all my tears have been used up

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
On another love, another love

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All my tears have been used up

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
On another love, another love

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All my tears have been used up

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
On another love, another love

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All my tears have been used up

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
On another love, another love
