1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,840
This is everything I did and I

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,800
Wave, don't tell me Heaven is a place on Earth

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,880
I wish I could rewind all the times that I didn't Show you what you really were

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,800
What you really were

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,840
Wave, you held me I wish that I put you first

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,120
I was wrong, I admit, numb from the kids While you were slipping through my fingertips

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,520
Taking every breath away With all of the mistakes I've made

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,440
From all the letters that I've made This is everything I didn't say

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,520
I wish I could have made you stay And I'm the only one to blame

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,520
I know that it's a little too late This is everything I didn't say

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,200
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,840
This is everything I did and I

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,640
Wake me up now And tell me this is all a bad dream

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,840
All the songs that I wrote, all the wrongs That I hoped would erase from your memory

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm a man of fear

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,680
Oh, teen or two A broken and empty heart

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,880
If that was I, I should have fought all the hours I lost Wish I could bring it back to the start

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,680
Taking every breath away With all of the mistakes I've made

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,280
From all the letters that I've made This is everything I didn't say

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,640
I wish I could have made you stay And I'm the only one to blame

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,080
I know that it's a little too late This is everything I didn't say

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,520
I hope you know You are just right

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,800
To make this right, whoa, whoa

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,560
Someday I'll be sure To pass each other by

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,800
Until that time

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,600
Taking every breath away With all of the mistakes I've made

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,120
From all the letters that I've made This is everything I didn't say

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,560
I wish I could have made you stay And I'm the only one to blame

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,680
I know that it's a little too late This is everything I didn't say

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,920
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,000
This is everything I didn't say Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
