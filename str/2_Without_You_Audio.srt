1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,560
You said that we would always be Without you I feel lost at sea

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,680
Through the darkness you'd hide with me Like the wind we'd be wild and free

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:42,360
You said you'd follow me anywhere Through your eyes

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,280
Tell me you won't be there

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,480
I gotta learn how to love without you I gotta carry my cross without you

6
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm stuck in the middle and I'm just about to Figure it out without you

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,800
And I'm not sitting on without you Fuck I'm blowing up without you

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm gonna tear this city down without you I'm going body in clouds without you

9
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:36,920
Now I'm running, moving my dear From myself and the truth I fear

10
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,280
My heart is beating, I can't see clear How I'm wishing that you were here

11
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:54,120
You said you'd follow me anywhere Through your eyes

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,880
Tell me you won't be there

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,000
I gotta learn how to love without you I gotta carry my cross without you

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,440
I'm stuck in the middle and I'm just about to Figure it out without you

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:19,320
And I'm not sitting on without you Fuck I'm blowing up without you

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm gonna tear this city down without you I'm going body in clouds without you

17
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm not sitting on without you
