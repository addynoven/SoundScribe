00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So this woman was on a train in New Jersey.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Let's call her Tipsy.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
And all of a sudden, Tipsy overhears some guys talking trash about her.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
These guys, who we'll call the Germans.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,900
Now I don't know if they were actually talking trash about her,

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,300
but Tipsy believes they are and she doesn't like it one bit.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,000
No! Tell me why the f*** you guys...

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,600
He's so f***ing scared of my son.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,200
Please...

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Now Tipsy, she's on the train with this guy.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,900
And it's unclear if he's her boyfriend or her husband,

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,500
so we'll just call him Busbund.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Now Busbund, he doesn't think the Germans said anything.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
I can handle my own.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,500
Breathe. Stop this or I'm never gonna talk to them.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,200
And here's where it all goes downhill.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,800
She suddenly figures out that they aren't from the US.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,000
How about you get the f*** out of our country?

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Do not!

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,400
How come my f***ing ambushes speak of last words?

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
And poor Busbund, he's just over here trying to de-escalate.

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,900
I'm an immigrant. You know I'm an immigrant too. You know that, right?

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,300
But I'm a citizen of the US, so it's okay.

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,400
Oh, but there's more.

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,200
So this whole exchange gets recorded and uploaded to Reddit.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,900
And people are just roasting her.

27
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,000
This woman sucks!

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,300
She sounds like a bigot!

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,900
Hey, what's Germany ever done wrong?

30
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,500
So they find all her social media and they start attacking it,

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,100
and then she's got to make that private.

32
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,500
And the backlash got so bad, by sheer f***ing coincidence,

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,700
this young woman, who's a teenager, who just happens to be blonde,

34
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,100
and just happens to share the exact same legal name as Tipsy,

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,600
she starts getting harassed.

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,500
I have had to go as far as to delete everything off my Facebook and change my name.

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
And during all this, someone figures out where Tipsy works,

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,900
and they show the video to her corporate bosses over at this RX company she works at.

39
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,100
They not only fired her over this video,

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,700
they issued an official apology to anyone she hurt.

41
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,700
And all this happened on a New Jersey transit, so shout out to New Jersey.
