1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
Those hardest to love needed most I watched our bodies turn to ghosts

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,760
Such good friends it has to end, it always does

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,880
The way life is, do we take that risk?

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,480
And so it all boils down to this We've got our aim but we might miss

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,960
We are too fragile just to guess And I've been in this place before

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:54,640
We'll find out who we are but we want more That's human nature at its best

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,960
What if we ruin it all? And we love like fools

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:12,240
And do what we have, we lose And I don't want you to go but I want you so

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,240
So tell me what we choose

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:37,760
Friends, I watched as as we changed The feelings in my headspace rearranged

11
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:45,520
I want you more than I've wanted, anyone? Isn't that dangerous?

12
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,440
The anticipation before the kiss Mirrored in my shaking lips

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,920
Oh God, I feel so unprepared The two of us so out of place

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,560
My feelings written on my face Got what I want but now I'm scared

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,000
What if we ruin it all? And we love like fools

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,280
And do what we have, we lose And I don't want you to go but I want you so

17
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:50,640
So tell me what, tell me what we choose What we choose, what we choose

18
00:02:50,640 --> 00:03:05,200
What if we ruin it all? And we love like fools

19
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:16,480
And do what we have, we lose And I don't want you to go but I want you so

20
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:28,320
So tell me what, tell me what, tell me what we choose
