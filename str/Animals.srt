1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Baby I'm playing on you tonight, hunt you down eat your life

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Just like animals, animals, like animals, balls

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Maybe you think that you can hide, I can smell your symphonies

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Just like animals, animals, like animals, balls

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Baby I'm paying, show what you try to do to me

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But we get a little bit of insight into you, yeah

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're like a drug that's killing me, I cut you out entirely

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But I get so high but I'm inside of you

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah you can start over, you can run free

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can find another visionless sea

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You can pretend it's meant to be

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But you can't stay away from me

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can still hear you making that sound

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Taking me down, rolling underground

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can pretend that it was me, but no

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, baby I'm playing on you tonight, hunt you down eat your life

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Just like animals, animals, like animals, balls

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe you think that you can hide, I can smell your symphonies

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Just like animals, animals, like animals, balls

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Baby I'm paying, so if I run it's not enough

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're still in my head forever, sir

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So you can do what you wanna do, hey

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I love your lies, I'll eat them up

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But don't deny the animal

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Becomes alive and I'm inside of you

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah you can start over, you can run free

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can find another visionless sea

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can pretend it's meant to be

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But you can't stay away from me

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can still hear you making that sound

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Taking me down, rolling underground

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can pretend that it was me, but no

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, baby I'm playing on you tonight, hunt you down eat your life

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Just like animals, animals, like animals, balls

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Maybe you think that you can hide, I can smell your symphonies

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just like animals, animals, like animals, balls

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Baby I'm, don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can't deny, nah, nah, nah

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That peace inside, side, side, side

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No girl, no lie, no lie, no lie

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can't deny, you can't deny

44

Just like animals, animals, like animals, balls

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
