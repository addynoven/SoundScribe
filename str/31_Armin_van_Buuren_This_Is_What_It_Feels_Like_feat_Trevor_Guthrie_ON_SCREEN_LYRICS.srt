🎵Nobody here knocking at my door🎵

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,600
🎵Music🎵

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,200
🎵The sound of silence I can't take anymore🎵

🎵Music🎵

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
🎵Oh how I miss such a beautiful sound🎵

9

🎵Music🎵

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,400
🎵And I don't even know how I survive🎵

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,800
🎵I won't make it to the shore without your light🎵

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,800
🎵No I don't even know if I'm alive🎵

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,400
🎵This is what it feels like🎵

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,600
🎵Music🎵

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,600
🎵Nothing to hold but the memories and frames🎵

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,400
🎵Oh they remind me of the battle I face🎵

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,800
🎵Without you love, without you I try🎵

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,200
🎵Somebody say to me I'm going down🎵

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,200
🎵And I don't even know how I survive🎵

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,000
🎵I won't make it to the shore without your light🎵

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,600
🎵No I don't even know if I'm alive🎵

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,800
🎵Oh without you now🎵

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
🎵This is what it feels like🎵

🎵Music🎵

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,800
🎵This is what it feels like🎵

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,800
🎵And I don't even know how I survive🎵

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,600
🎵I won't make it down the road with one headline🎵

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,600
🎵No I don't even know if I'm alive🎵

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,400
🎵Oh without you now🎵

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
