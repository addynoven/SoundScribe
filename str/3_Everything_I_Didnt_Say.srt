1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,820
This is everything I did and I

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,300
Wait, don't tell me

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,660
Heaven is a place on Earth

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,100
I wish I could rewind all the times that I didn't

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,940
Show you what you really were

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,840
What you really were

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,260
Wait, you held me

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,680
I wish that I put you first

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,400
I was wrong I admit

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,200
None from the kids while you were slippin' through my fingertips

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,920
Takin' every breath away

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
With all of the mistakes I've made

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,120
From all the letters that I say

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,400
This is everything I didn't say

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,880
I wish I could have made you stay

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,680
And I'm the only one to blame

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,080
I know that it's a little too late

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,400
This is everything I didn't say

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,160
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,860
This is everything I didn't say

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,340
Wake me up now

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,800
And tell me this is all a bad dream

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,240
All the songs that I wrote

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,800
All the wrongs that I hoped would erase from your memory

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,180
Oh, teen or two

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,720
A broken and empty heart

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,200
That was I should have bought

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,420
All the hours I lost

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,820
Wish I could bring it back to the start

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,100
Taking every breath away

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,860
With all the mistakes I've made

34
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,100
From all the letters that I've saved

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,380
This is everything I didn't say

36
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,100
I wish I could have made you stay

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,820
And I'm the only one to blame

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,060
I know that it's a little too late

39
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,140
This is everything I didn't say

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,100
I hope you know

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,580
You are just right

42
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,300
To make this right

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,060
Whoa, whoa

44
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,140
Someday I'm sure

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,540
We'll pass each other by

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,340
Until that time

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,980
Taking every breath away

48
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,700
With all the mistakes I've made

49
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,940
From all the letters that I've saved

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,180
This is everything I didn't say

51
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,900
I wish I could have made you stay

52
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,660
And I'm the only one to blame

53
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,900
I know that it's a little too late

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,700
This is everything I didn't say

55
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:42,140
Oh, oh, oh

56
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,780
This is everything I didn't say

57
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:54,540
Oh, oh, oh
