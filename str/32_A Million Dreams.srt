1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I close my eyes and I can see a world that's waiting up for me

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that I call my own

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Through the dark, through the door, through where no one's been before

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but it feels like home

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We can live in a world that we design

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Cause every night I lie in bed, the brightest colors fill my head

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A million dreams are keeping me awake

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think of what the world could be, a vision of the one I see

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A million dreams is all it's gonna take

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There's a house we can build, every room inside is filled

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
with things from far away

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Special things I compile, each one there to make you smile

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
on a rainy day

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Run away to a world that we design

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Every night I lie in bed, the brightest colors fill my head

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A million dreams are keeping me awake

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think of what the world could be, a vision of the one I see

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A million dreams is all it's gonna take

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
However big, however small, let me be part of it all

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Share your dreams with me

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You may be right, you may be wrong, but say that you'll bring me along

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
To the world you see, to the world I close my eyes and see

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I close my eyes and see

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Every night I lie in bed, the brightest colors fill my head

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A million dreams are keeping me awake

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think of what the world could be, a vision of the one I see

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A million dreams is all it's gonna take

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
For the world we're gonna make

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
For the world we're gonna make
